  Fishing Vessels Monitoring System
</h1> 

> Improve monitoring and controlling of the activities of fishing vessels

## What is it ?
The proposedsolution aims to establish a robust monitoring system to accuratelytrack fishing boat movements during their entry and exit into the sea , enhancing both security and the safety of fishermen. 


## Main features

- Visualization of fishing vessels' real time **positions** (VMS)
- Visualization of fishing vessels' declarative **fishing activity** data (ERS and FLUX)
- Visualization of fishing vessels' historical **controls** and **violations**
- Visualization of [regulated fishing areas] of the french and european regulations
- Computation of fishing vessels' real time belonging to [fleet segments] as defined by the [European Fishing Control Agency (EFCA)] in its [risk assessment methodology]
- Real time fraud detection [alerts]
- Computation of fishing vessels' real time [risk factor ], a metric developed in the context of the Monitorfish project that aims to help FMC agents **prioritize vessels to control** based on all the above elements 
- Administration panel that allows admins to
    - Update regulation data : update authorized fishing areas / periods / gears...
    - Update the definitions of [fleet segments]
    - [Stear control priorities] by dynamically adjuting the control priority level of each fleet segment
